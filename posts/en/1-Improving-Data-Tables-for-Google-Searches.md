# Improving Data Tables for Google Searches

That's right, Data tables. If we are going to improve our tables so that they appear in the results listing of a Google research (SPERS) it is important to remember the difference between what we will call table of contents and table of data.
At the beginning of the web, developers noticed that they could use tables to distribute and organize content on the page: this image beside that and above this text on the right, while the main text is in a single cell on the left. This is now considered archaic for a simple reason, but I'll give you two: The first and foremost is that CSS gives you much better control over the content of a page, ensuring better browser compatibility and better screen adaptation.
The second reason I give you is that this practice looks a lot like a poorly trained office employee who is using Microsoft Excel to create a printable memo that could very well be done in Word. It looks good on paper, but when you look at the original file, a mess is found. Imagine now what Google Search Engine "finds" when you use table of contents on your web page?

Therefore, if you want a better looking result in Google's search listing, and you should want it, because it makes your result more attractive to a visitor's click, then you should opt to use data tables.

## What is a data table?
It may seem obvious, but data tables are tables containing data, but logically arranged to allow actions such as queries and sometimes calculations. Simply throwing one piece of information below another, and others next to these, does not guarantee that they form a good data table.
Below are some simple rules for organizing data that will improve your table, be it vertical or horizontal. It's mportant to remember that data flow will depend on the amount of data entries:
- Data with sequence, progression, or comparison, among others, that group into many entries, almost always asks for a vertical table.
- Informative data, which usually forms a theme-value pair, almost always asks for a horizontal table.

The first rule is that a good data table preferably has a row or column that acts as headers identifying the following information for a column (or row) containing values ​​(subject column / value line).

### Vertical Tables
Good vertical tables will have at least some of the features below. They are not necessarily fixed rules, but are great indications of a good table:
- Data Columns - Vertical tables will have an identifiable data column that consistently represents a class or category of information. This makes the table more suitable for analysis.
- Titles - The th tag is used to declare titles for columns.
- Table Caption - The caption tag contains text that appears above a table, acting as a kind of title. Keywords should be used non-polluting.
- Context and its prominence - Titles, subtitles, and a column of data make a good table, but context is important. Google analyzes content near the table, which is likely to have a strong influence on its meaning. This includes the header tag (h1 through h6) but close above the table, as well as text above or below the table and the page title.
- Table Size - A table that is largely vertical (has many more rows than columns) or very horizontal (with many more columns than rows) is unlikely to be a table of contents.
- Standardized Information - Data in a column usually follows an information standard that facilitates vertical analysis.
- Related Data Columns - Tables with two related data columns are common. Unfortunately, at this time, Google Table Search algorithms focus on identifying only one subject column.
- Horizontal Analysis - Once a column of data is pinned, Google seeks to analyze the relationship with the others. Semantic indexing of surrounding data and header identification happens here. Sometimes all data fits perfectly into a semantic vocabulary.
- Units - Good tables show numeric data. Units of measurement help in its clarity.

### Horizontal Tables
Horizontal tables are widely used for listing data in the Theme-Value relationship (Subject-Information). An excellent example of this are the tables that appear to the right of most wikipedia pages.
In such cases, many of the indications previously made for vertical tables cannot be followed exactly, but some can be adapted.
The main thing is to organize so that the theme-value relationship is always kept in the same order, otherwise the flow of information is impaired.
Titles (headers) used by the tab <th> in this case usually define table sessions, organizing similar information groups.

## Examples
Here we show two good examples of tables.

In both images, I pointed to the use of the title of the information and the flow of the information can also be noted.

## I must use tables on my page
The short answeer is yes. A good table enriches your page and organizes information that, if it would be presented in text or descriptive listing, would make reading tiresome and hurt the visitor's interest in staying on the page.
The principles I explained in this article will help your tables be more likely to appear in Google's results listing, improving your page ranking and potential visitor interest.
